# Netflix Content Analysis and Recommendation System

# Project Overview <br>
The **Netflix Content Analysis and Recommendation System** project leverages a comprehensive dataset of Netflix's library to provide insights into content distribution, trends, and user preferences. This project integrates data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning techniques to build a robust recommendation system, offering personalized content suggestions to users. The goal is to enhance user engagement and facilitate a better understanding of Netflix's content offerings.

# Key Features <br>
1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation** <br>
**- Null Value Handling:** Identification and appropriate treatment of missing data to ensure reliable analysis. <br>
**- Duplicate Removal:** Elimination of duplicate entries to maintain data quality. <br>
**- Date Conversion:** Transformation of date columns into appropriate formats for time-series analysis. <br>

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** <br>
**- Content Distribution Visualization:** Use of count plots and pie charts to visualize the distribution of movies and TV shows across various categories. <br>
**- Content Ratings Analysis:** Examination of popular content ratings through visualizations, providing insights into user preferences. <br>
**- Trend Analysis:** Exploration of trends in content releases over time, including monthly and yearly analysis of movie and TV show releases. <br>

3. **Feature Engineering** <br>
**- Genre and Duration Metrics:** Creation of features to quantify the number of genres and duration of content, enabling deeper analysis and modeling. <br>
**- Content Type Classification:** Development of a binary feature indicating whether a title is a movie or a TV show, enhancing predictive modeling capabilities. <br>

4. **Machine Learning for Recommendations** <br>
**- Content-Based Recommendation System:** Implementation of a recommendation system utilizing cosine similarity, allowing users to discover titles similar to their favorites based on genre and director attributes. <br>
